![Paige Taylor](/static/img/about-me-photo.jpg)

My name is Paige and Iâ€™m a young, aspiring photographer based in Brighton. I aspire to a career in fashion photography; however, I am keen on gaining experience working in any area of photography. I have completed 3 years of studying photography, receiving A at A-level and distinction at level 3/4 UAL post A-level foundation diploma year. In my time studying and practicing photography, I have gained experience in core practises of photography, including shooting both in studios and on location, shooting on and developing film as well as key skills in lighting. My portfolio highlights what I have learned through my study and practice and is available for viewing on this website. 

I am always open to being contacted regarding available work or price listings and can be reached through all of the contact details below.
